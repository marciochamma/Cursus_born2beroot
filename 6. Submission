Generate a signature
# cd VirtualBox\ VMs (go to Virtual Box folder)
# ls (visualize the folder <virtual_machine>)
# cd <virtual_machine> (go to VM folder)
# sha1sum <virtual_machine_name>.vdi (generate the signature using sha1sum. It takes a few minutes)
Example of output 4f9a0cdd574046352091473acf50c5f101722424  Born2beRoot.vdi
Finaly, create a file signature.txt with output and submit to evaluation

Attention
Before start the evaluation, save state by snapshot, because VM will be modified and signature can be modified too.
After the evaluation, restore the Original State for next evaluation.
